Solutions
=========

This is a Harry Potter themed puzzle hunt that involves looking through Pensieve memories in order to regain the memory of who you are and why you are here.

The hunt consists of an intro puzzle (to open the door to Dumbledore's office), 7 normal puzzles (represented by the 7 memory wisps in the pensieve), and the meta (the pensieve itself).

### Intro puzzle

Each answer is a word or phrase that contains one of the 3W Team Runpeng members written on the sign: KYC, BECKY, TOMMY, CLARE, BEN, EVA, STALY, MICHAEL.

| Clue | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| 561, for example | CAR*MICHA***E***L* NUMBER |
| Brief persuasive speech | EL*EVA*TOR **P**ITCH |
| Cereal with marshmallows | LU**C***KY C*HARMS |
| Flows into the Leader River | CA*STALY* R**I**VER |
| "In unbounded numerical data, over a quarter of values will begin with 1" | *BEN*F**O**RD'S LAW |
| Nonsense | *TOMMY*R**O**T |
| Tom's love interest | *BECKY* T**H**ATCHER |
| Uncommitted major | UNDE**C***LARE*D |

Ordering by the order of names on the sign and taking the outlined letters gives **CHOCO PIE**, the password to open the door.

### King's Cross

Each answer is a phrase with two rhyming words, in alphabetical order.

| Clue | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| An umbrella that protects you from pressurized sprays. | AEROSOL PARASOL |
| A bird's "thumb", made out of a peppery salad green. | ARUGULA ALULA |
| A place of worship made out of a light-colored wood. | BIRCH CHURCH |
| A quick and skillful robbery. | DEFT THEFT |
| An eagles nest, taken over by some sprites (alt. spelling). | FAIRY AERIE |
| A California state flower, if left unwatered. | FLOPPY POPPY |
| Short and stout, and still steaming. | HOT TEAPOT |
| A rodent found in a residence. | HOUSE MOUSE |
| A thermosetting resin with an -OH group. | HYDROXY EPOXY |
| Refuse to acknowledge the post-performance. | IGNORE ENCORE |
| Mass emigration from the state kyc, Michael Xu, and Sumit are from. | TEXAS EXODUS |
| A lizard from the largest city in the Baja peninsula. | TIJUANA IGUANA |
| A pressed sandwich featuring a summer squash. | ZUCCHINI PANINI |

The words can be uniquely placed in the Criss Cross grid.

          A E R I E                            
            R                                  
            O

            O                                  
            L                                  
```

Taking the numbered letters gives the final clue *EXACTLY AN EIGHTH OF PIE*, so the answer is **PRECISE SLICE**.

### The Sorting Hat

Each clue on the left can be paired with one on the right, such that the answer to the right clue is the answer to the left clue, with an adjective prepended at the beginning. For example, *Sci-fi author* can be **CARD**, and *A magic effect where a card inserted into the middle of a deck re-appears at the top* is **AMBITIOUS CARD**.

| Left clue | Answer | Right clue | Answer
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sci-fi author | CARD | A magic effect where a card inserted into the middle of a deck re-appears at the top | AMBITIOUS CARD |
| A sperm whale in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* hits this and dies | GROUND | Area where circuses, shows, and other outdoor festivities are held | FAIRGROUND |
| It’s written on a sign to advise only ~50% of people to pass | MEN | Biblical Magi | WISE MEN |
| The Americas | NEW WORLD | Dystopian novel | BRAVE NEW WORLD |
| Speech sound | PHONE | In modern times, we almost all have one | SMARTPHONE |
| A time zone at UTC+05:30 | IST | Not a patriot | LOYALIST |
| Type of radio | HAM | One of the families in *To Kill a Mockingbird* | CUNNINGHAM |
| Meeting | VISITING | Phrase written on the In Jail square | JUST VISITING |
| Plan or specification | DESIGN | The theory that life and the universe could not have arisen by chance | INTELLIGENT DESIGN |
| Aves, for example | CLASS | Type 45 destroyer | DARING CLASS |
| ケ | KE | Unit for the slope of a titration curve (mmol/pH), named after a chemist | SLYKE |
| A mnemonic for the spaces on a staff | FACE | **What this clue is written in** | BOLDFACE |

Each adjective is associated with one of the Hogwarts Houses (for example, Slytherin students are described as AMBITIOUS). Since no two words in a house have the same length, this allows us to fill in the words in a unique way.

- Gryffindor: (BOLD)F**A**CE, (BRAVE) NE**W** WORLD, (DARING) C**L**ASS
- Hufflepuff: (LOYAL)I**S**T, (FAIR)G**R**OUND, (JUST) **V**ISITING
- Ravenclaw: (SMART)PHO**N**E, (WISE) M**E**N, (INTELLIGENT) D**E**SIGN
- Slytherin: (AMBITIOUS) CA**R**D, (SLY)K**E**, (CUNNING)H**A**M

The 12 letters in order spell ANSWER **REVEAL**.

### Wizard's Wireless

The flavor text clues *phonemes*. Each answer to a Sent clue can have its first and last phonemes removed to get a homophonic answer to a Received clue. For example, *Supplying* can be **ISSUING**, and removing the initial vowel sound /ɪ/ and ending consonant sound ng /ŋ/ gives **SHOEY** (/ʃui/), which is *A drinking boot, in Australia*.

| Sent clue | Answer | Received clue | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Game company | NINTENDO /nɪntɛndo/ | Have as one's objective | INTEND /ɪntɛnd/ |
| The act of watching something, or failure to watch something? | OVERSIGHT /ovɚsaɪt/ | Beautiful palace | VERSAILLES /vɚsaɪ/ |
| General in the 82nd Airborne Division | TROBAUGH /trobɔ/ | Ron Weasley thought this was embarassing | ROBE /rob/ |
| Usmanov or Lisin, for example | OLIGARCH /ɔlɪgɑɹk/ | To flirt in Spanish | LIGAR /ligɑr/ |
| Father of the piano | CLEMENTI /kləmɛnti/ | Grief | LAMENT /ləmɛnt/ |
| Supplying | ISSUING /ɪʃuɪŋ/ | A drinking boot, in Australia | SHOEY /ʃui/ |

The answers to the sent clues form a chain, where the last phoneme of one clue is identical (or very similar) to the first phoneme of the next:

**N** INTEND **O** OVERSIGH **T** ROB **AUGH/O** LIGAR **CH/C** LEMENT **I** SSUI **NG**  
/**n** ɪntɛnd **o** vɚsaɪ **t** rob **ɔ** lɪgɑɹ **k** ləmɛnt **i** ʃuɪ **ŋ**/

These phonemes in order sound out /notɔkiŋ/, or **NO TALKING**.

### Wizard's Chess

The flavor text mentions Penultima, and the Wikipedia article describes it as "a game of inductive logic", where "the rules for each piece... are initially kept secret from the players." In this puzzle, you play with unknown rules for the pieces against a computer AI (which, unfortunately, does know the rules).

To solve the puzzle, you must discover the rules (or enough of the rules) in order to beat the AI. It turns out that the kings and pawns move as in normal chess, but the other pieces move differently, and the rules for your white pieces are different from the rules for the enemy black pieces. After winning a game, the message *ABECEDARIAN BIG CHESS* appears on the board. A quick Google search tells us that this is a chess variant containing 26 types of pieces, one for each letter of the alphabet. The rules for all Abecedarian Big Chess pieces can be found [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/unequal.dir/abchess/abeced-home.html). The pieces used in this puzzle are:

- White rook: normal chess rook (R)
- White knight: camel (C)
- White bishop: eagle (E)
- White queen: teleporter (T)
- Black rook: pao (P)
- Black knight: nightrider (N)
- Black bishop: overtaker (O)
- Black queen: immobilizer (I)

Using this mapping on the sequence of pieces at the bottom of the puzzle gives the answer, **PROTECTION**.

### The Deluminator

Every word that you enter toggles (turns on if currently off, and turns off if on) all of the light bulbs that correspond to the word when written in Braille. The goal of the puzzle is to find a set of 8 words or less, that together turn off all the light bulbs. Only valid words (from the TWL dictionary) that are between 2 to 8 letters long (inclusive) can be used.

There are several viable strategies for solving this puzzle. First, it should be clear that we should start with 8-letter words to turn off all the lights on the rightmost block, then 7-letter words to turn off the next block, and so on. We need to average turning off one entire block with each word, so we should optimize for being able to turn off multiple blocks with one word.

There are also many solutions. One solution that I found by hand is [OVERWORK, TOMORROW, WILLOWY, UNWELL, SNOW, WIFE, IT, OH]. A solution with only 5 words that I found by scripting is [UNIQUELY, COLORFUL, CHIPMUNK, DAMP, BUZZ].

After turning off all the lights, the word **BANISHED** is shown in Braille, which is the answer.

### Quidditch

This puzzle consists of four independent sub-puzzles.

#### Beaters

The two mp3 files are excerpts of Fred Chopin's Sunshine Etude in F Major and George Handel's Gavotte in G Major, respectively, which correspond to the beaters Fred and George. The first letters of the flavor text spell "BPM ASCII". To figure out the letters, you need to find the BPM that the excerpts are played at, and convert them to letters in ASCII. You can figure out the BPM either by adjusting an online metronome very carefully until it matches the tempo of the music exactly, or by opening the mp3 files in sound software such as Audacity and calculating the distances between the down beats obvious in the contour image. The tempos are 117 and 98 BPM respectively, which gives the letters **U** and **B**.

#### Chasers

Each mixed drink is the combination of two pictures, but the resulting set of letters is also an anagram of a chaser (the first name of a Gryffindor chaser), alcohol (OH), and a secret ingredient (an additional letter).

- ALOHA + ENGINE = ANGELINA + OH + E
- ASCII + HALO = ALICIA + OH + S
- HEAT + LOKI = KATIE + OH + L

This gives the letters **E**, **S**, and **L** for the Gryffindor chasers Angelina, Alicia, and Katie respectively.

#### Keeper

The flavor text clues Cluekeeper, a popular puzzle hunt phone app. You need to install Cluekeeper (if not installed already) and enter DGDLTC as a puzzle hunt start code. This brings you to a mini-hunt on Cluekeeper with a single round.

- The clue for the round start code is "What is his name?". The answer is **OLIVER WOOD**, the name of the Gryffindor seeker shown in the puzzle.
- The clue for the round puzzle is "another kind of keeper (1)". The answer is **B**, i.e. a beekeeper.

Note: it turns out that only one person can use this start code at a time. If entering the start code on Cluekeeper doesn't work for you, it is likely because someone else has already entered it. If you have already entered it, you can click "Uninstall hunt" in Cluekeeper so that others can also try out the contents of the mini-hunt.

#### Seeker

Either searching "Seeking Syren" from the flavor text or reverse image searching the grid will lead you to the [Live Journal post](https://zotmeister.livejournal.com/7734.html) or [Mystery Hunt puzzle](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2010/puzzles/2009/seeking_scotchy/) describing the rules of this logic puzzle. The path goes through R, O, H, K, and finally ends at **B** (which is where the Snitch is).

(Note: the starting letter Z represents the scar on Gryffindor seeker Harry Potter, but that is not relevant to solving the puzzle.)

Arranging the letters in order of the Gryffindor team at the top of the page gives the answer, **BUBBLES**.

### The Time Turner

This puzzle is a memorial of the puzzles in the One Night puzzle hunt from Winter break 2018, mostly from the [Seer round](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/).

- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer STALYC](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__trzhang.html). The puzzle-loop is trivial to solve; however, the catch is that it surrounds the word "REMEMBER". This means that you must remember the mechanic for the original puzzle, which is to take the remaining letters and apply the Atbash Cipher. The remaining letter is S, which corresponds to **H**.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer EVA](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__cmzhang.html). In the original puzzle, overlaying the image with the *SHADY LABYRINTH* MIT Aquarium puzzle written by Runpeng and Clare gives a maze that when solved, goes through the following letters/numbers: DIVIDE ANSWER BY 34.8829324737 LOOK AT FIRST EIGHT DIGITS IN PAIRS, which means to compute TAU/34.8829324737 = 0.18012205 and convert to letters, 18 01 22 05 -> R A V E. In the overlay in this puzzle, the "x10^" comes right before the second 7. That means we instead compute TAU/34.882932473x10^7 = 0.00000001, which when converted to letters gives 00 00 00 01 -> _ _ _ **A**.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer BECKYSHI](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__michaelx.html). The winning move is Rh8++, which goes through the letter **P** in the original puzzle grid (and an empty space).
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer MICHAEL](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__kyc2915.html). However, I couldn't get the original puzzle to work, so I instead made a different puzzle (in the same spirit) and to compensate, rewarded 3 letters for this sub-puzzle. In this sub-puzzle, the value of N is small enough that Wolfram Alpha and other prime sievers can factor it, and therefore compute ``φ(N)``. This allows us to directly compute the original message by evaluating ``ciphertext^(e^⁻¹ (mod φ(N))) (mod N)``. The original message is *AVENGERSPARTICLE*. This clues **PYM**, which is fitting because the Avengers used Pym particles to travel back in time.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer CLARE](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__beckyshi.html). The melody is G A G, which translates to Glutamic acid, represented by the letter **E**.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer TRZHANG](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__stalyc.html). The image links to `/files/Wonderland.png`, where Wonderland is a terminal station on the Boston blue line. Finding the letters in all the stations gives the message *THELETTERISM*, so the letter is **M**.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer BENJAMIN](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__evayeung.html). Again, some of the pixels are a slight shade of gray, and those pixels draw out the Chinese symbol 圈, or "circle". The letter is **O**.
- This corresponds to [A puzzle with the answer KEVINYCHEN](https://team-runpeng.firebaseapp.com/soothsayer/puzzles/seer_round__bmatt.html). There is a 24x24 blank image `d12586269025.png`, which matches the 'X' image in the original puzzle that was used as a terminal marker. The images for the next Fibonacci numbers have sizes 18x18, 15x15, 13x13, 5x5, 15x15, which spell out *ROMEO*, the NATO alphabet character for **R**.
- This puzzle corresponds to the 3W wing photo overlay puzzle from the One Night puzzle hunt Villager round. If this image is overlayed on top of the wing photo, Yaning is circled, so the answer is **Y**.

The answer is **HAPPY MEMORY**.

### The Pensieve

Each answer clues a Harry Potter charm or jinx (clued by the Jynx pokemon on the second line). The spells are ordered by length, from 6 letters to 12 letters:

| Puzzle answer | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| REVEAL | Revelio (charm) |
| BUBBLES | Ebublio (jinx) |
| BANISHED | Depulso (charm) |
| NO TALKING | Silencio (charm) |
| PROTECTION | Protego (charm) |
| HAPPY MEMORY | Expecto Patronum (charm) |
| PRECISE SLICE | Diffindo (charm) |

The flavor text then clues wand movements ("wander", "move"). Although not all wand movements are consistent across different games, these 7 are. For example, the wand movement for Revelio clearly spells out the letter R. The other letters are E, U, N, I, O, N, which together spell **REUNION**.

Note: this meta was unintentionally very similar to the 2017 Mystery Hunt [Wizard Meta](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2017/round/wizard.html) as well as the [Charming](http://pennypark.fun/puzzle/charming/) puzzle from Wizard's Hollow round of 2020 Mystery Hunt. I was not aware of either puzzle when writing this one.
