  "<span class='green'>CHOCO PIE</span>!" you exclaim.<br/><br/>

  The door opens slowly, by itself.<br/><br/>

  As you cautiously walk through, you see a small office on the other side, with small tables scattered about.
  On one table is a pointy black hat, ragged and wrinkled as if it has seen many years.
  On another table are a few bright fire-orange feathers, as if from a noble bird, scattered among pieces of dried ash.
  The entire space looks enchanted, like it belonged to a wise headmaster of magic.<br/><br/>

  But one particular thing catches your eye.
  In the corner is a silver metal basin, decorated with runes and bright stones, and filled with a wispy gas.
  You walk closer and see small wisps floating inside, beckoning you to plunge your head into them and discover their secret.
  Perhaps this is the key to regaining the memory of who you are and where you came from.<br/><br/>

    "Can we have some more normal puzzles (aka word puzzles) instead of these weird technical/interactive ones?"<br/><br/>

    "Sorry. I'd rather spend 10 hours writing a chess AI than a crossword puzzle."
